My Thesis for Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece

The general theme of my thesis is smart cities and more specifically the walking tours. I had to develop a web application and a mobile application. Via the web application, the user (the organizers of walks) will enter the data of each walk (description, images and coordinates) which are saved in remote MySQL database. These data will be displayed on mobile app, which is designed in Android OS. For the communication of the web and mobile app I created an API in PHP and in this way, the mobile app makes http calls in order to update the local database  (SQLite database). In order to build the api I used restful services and json for the representation of data. In mobile application, there is a map in which are appeared all the stations of the route - walk. For every station, there is extra material like text end image. Moreover the user of mobile application  can rate each stop depending on his actual real walk experience. Overall, the user can be informed of the planned walks, submit participation, rate stops, collect the walks in which he has participate and refresh the material of walks.
